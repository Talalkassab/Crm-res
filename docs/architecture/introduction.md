# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for CRM-RES, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Given the WhatsApp-centric nature and real-time requirements, this is a greenfield project optimized for:
- **Vercel + Supabase** for rapid development with built-in real-time capabilities
- **AWS Serverless** for enterprise scale with containerized microservices
- **Custom Python/Next.js** with WhatsApp Cloud API integration
