# Summary

This comprehensive fullstack architecture document provides the foundation for building CRM-RES, a culturally-intelligent WhatsApp automation platform for Saudi restaurants. The hybrid approach combines:

- **Python FastAPI microservices** for AI processing and Arabic language capabilities
- **Next.js TypeScript frontend** for a modern, responsive dashboard
- **Supabase** for managed PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time features
- **OpenRouter** for flexible LLM access with cost optimization
- **Containerized deployment** on AWS ECS Fargate for scalability

The architecture supports the core requirements of sub-30 second response times, 100,000 concurrent conversations, prayer-time awareness, and progressive automation from feedback collection to full ordering capabilities.

All components are designed for AI-driven development with clear interfaces, comprehensive testing strategies, and production-ready deployment configurations.
