# CRM-RES Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Achieve phased automation progression** - 40% routine inquiries (Month 1) → 60% (Month 3) → 80% (Month 6) while preserving cultural authenticity
- **Generate 20% revenue increase** through intelligent upselling and enhanced customer retention with culturally-aware personalization
- **Reduce operational costs by 35%** through staff transition from manual messaging to relationship management roles
- **Collect feedback from 60% of silent customers** through culturally appropriate, prayer-time aware prompting (vs industry standard 5%)
- **Maintain sub-30 second response times** for 95% of customer messages with seamless Arabic dialect processing
- **Sustain 4.5+ customer satisfaction scores** across all automated interactions while building trust through progressive feature adoption
- **Cut customer acquisition costs by 40%** through WhatsApp virality and automated referrals within local Saudi networks
- **Scale platform to 500+ restaurants** with <10 support staff by maintaining cultural intelligence competitive advantage

### Background Context

Saudi Arabian restaurants face a critical challenge: existing WhatsApp automation solutions cost 5,000-15,000 SAR monthly and lack cultural awareness, while 90% of customers never share feedback, leading to 60% customer churn within six months. Restaurant owners juggle 4-6 disconnected systems and spend 2-3 hours daily manually responding to WhatsApp messages, losing 15-20% of potential revenue from poor response times.

CRM-RES addresses this by creating a culturally-intelligent WhatsApp platform specifically designed for Saudi restaurants. Unlike international solutions that treat WhatsApp as a support channel, our platform embraces it as the primary commerce hub Saudi consumers prefer. The solution features Arabic dialect awareness, prayer time intelligence, personality matching systems, and a progressive automation approach that builds trust through starting with simple review collection before expanding to full ordering and customer relationship management.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The platform embodies a "WhatsApp-native conversational commerce" paradigm where restaurant interactions feel like chatting with a knowledgeable, culturally-aware friend. The owner dashboard follows a "single-pane-of-glass" approach, providing actionable insights without overwhelming non-technical users. Every interface element respects Saudi cultural norms while maintaining modern, intuitive design patterns.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational-First:** All customer interactions through natural WhatsApp chat flows, no forms or menus unless explicitly requested
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Restaurant owners start with simple metrics, drill down for details only when needed
- **Real-time Responsiveness:** Dashboard updates live as conversations happen, creating sense of control and immediacy
- **Mobile-Optimized Management:** Owners can manage everything from their phones, matching their WhatsApp-centric workflow

### Core Screens and Views
- **WhatsApp Conversation Interface** - Customer-facing chat with restaurant personality, menu browsing, order placement
- **Owner Dashboard Home** - Real-time metrics, satisfaction scores, branch performance comparison
- **Feedback Analytics View** - Sentiment trends, common complaints, positive highlights with Arabic/English toggle
- **Conversation Monitor** - Live conversation feed with escalation alerts and intervention capabilities
- **Personality Configuration** - Select and preview AI personality templates with sample conversations
- **Branch Management** - Multi-location routing rules, performance comparison, staff assignments
- **Reports & Insights** - Downloadable analytics, customer cohort analysis, revenue attribution

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG AA compliance for dashboard with RTL Arabic support, high contrast modes for outdoor mobile use, and voice navigation capabilities for hands-free restaurant management.

### Branding
Clean, professional design that adapts to each restaurant's brand colors and logo. WhatsApp conversations maintain platform-native feel while subtly incorporating restaurant identity through welcome messages and signature closings. No heavy branding that might feel inauthentic in messaging context.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Customer Interface:** Native WhatsApp (iOS/Android) with no additional app required
- **Owner Dashboard:** Progressive Web App optimized for mobile-first (70% usage on phones) with desktop support for detailed analytics
- **Staff Interface:** Tablet-optimized escalation handling for kitchen/counter staff

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Utilizing a monorepo structure to maintain all platform components (frontend dashboard, backend services, AI processors, WhatsApp integrations) in a single repository. This enables atomic commits across the full stack, simplified dependency management, and consistent deployment workflows. Packages will be organized as: `/apps/dashboard`, `/apps/api`, `/services/ai`, `/services/whatsapp`, `/packages/shared`.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo** - The platform will use containerized microservices for separation of concerns while maintaining monorepo benefits:
- **WhatsApp Gateway Service** - Handles all WhatsApp API interactions, message queuing, rate limiting
- **AI Processing Service** - Manages Gemini Flash conversations, sentiment analysis, personality matching  
- **Analytics Service** - Real-time metrics processing, dashboard data aggregation
- **Core API** - Restaurant management, branch routing, user authentication
- **Notification Service** - Alert escalation, owner notifications, monitoring
All services communicate through event-driven architecture using message queues for resilience.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid with Arabic Language Coverage**:
- **Unit Tests** - 80% code coverage for business logic, Arabic text processing validation
- **Integration Tests** - API endpoint testing, WhatsApp webhook simulation, database transactions
- **E2E Tests** - Critical user journeys including Arabic conversation flows
- **Manual Testing Convenience** - Debug dashboard for conversation replay, test phone number provisioning
- **Performance Tests** - Load testing for 100K concurrent conversations, Arabic NLP processing speed

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router for dashboard, React Server Components for performance
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with RTL support, Shadcn/ui component library for consistency
- **Backend Language:** Python FastAPI for AI services (better ML library support), Node.js/TypeScript for real-time operations
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions) for primary data, Redis for caching and session management
- **AI/ML Stack:** Gemini Flash 2.0 for conversations, OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, Langchain for conversation management
- **Message Queue:** BullMQ for reliable job processing and WhatsApp message queuing
- **Hosting:** Vercel for frontend, Railway for backend services, Cloudflare R2 for media storage
- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking, PostHog for product analytics, custom Arabic conversation quality metrics
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with WhatsApp number verification for restaurant owners
- **API Design:** RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation, GraphQL for complex dashboard queries
- **Development Tools:** Turborepo for monorepo management, Docker for local development environment
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for testing and deployment, preview environments for each PR
- **Security:** JWT tokens with refresh rotation, API rate limiting per restaurant, webhook signature verification
