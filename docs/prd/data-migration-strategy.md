# Data Migration Strategy

## Customer Data Import
For restaurants with existing customer databases, the platform will support bulk import to preserve valuable customer relationships:

- **CSV/Excel Import:** Standard format templates for customer names, phone numbers, order history, preferences
- **POS Integration:** Direct API import from common Saudi POS systems (Foodics, Marn, POSRocket)
- **Gradual Migration:** Phased approach starting with VIP customers, then active customers, finally historical data
- **Data Validation:** Automatic phone number formatting, duplicate detection, and data quality checks
- **Privacy Compliance:** Customer consent verification for WhatsApp messaging per Saudi PDPL requirements
- **Historical Preservation:** Maintain previous order patterns and preferences to enable immediate personalization

## Migration Timeline
- **Pre-launch:** Import VIP customer list for pilot testing
- **Week 1:** Active customer migration (ordered in last 90 days)
- **Week 2-4:** Historical data import with validation
- **Ongoing:** Daily sync with POS systems for new customers
