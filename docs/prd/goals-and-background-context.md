## Background Context

Saudi Arabian restaurants face a critical challenge: existing WhatsApp automation solutions cost 5,000-15,000 SAR monthly and lack cultural awareness, while 90% of customers never share feedback, leading to 60% customer churn within six months. Restaurant owners juggle 4-6 disconnected systems and spend 2-3 hours daily manually responding to WhatsApp messages, losing 15-20% of potential revenue from poor response times.

CRM-RES addresses this by creating a culturally-intelligent WhatsApp platform specifically designed for Saudi restaurants. Unlike international solutions that treat WhatsApp as a support channel, our platform embraces it as the primary commerce hub Saudi consumers prefer. The solution features Arabic dialect awareness, prayer time intelligence, personality matching systems, and a progressive automation approach that builds trust through starting with simple review collection before expanding to full ordering and customer relationship management.
