# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The platform embodies a "WhatsApp-native conversational commerce" paradigm where restaurant interactions feel like chatting with a knowledgeable, culturally-aware friend. The owner dashboard follows a "single-pane-of-glass" approach, providing actionable insights without overwhelming non-technical users. Every interface element respects Saudi cultural norms while maintaining modern, intuitive design patterns.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational-First:** All customer interactions through natural WhatsApp chat flows, no forms or menus unless explicitly requested
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Restaurant owners start with simple metrics, drill down for details only when needed
- **Real-time Responsiveness:** Dashboard updates live as conversations happen, creating sense of control and immediacy
- **Mobile-Optimized Management:** Owners can manage everything from their phones, matching their WhatsApp-centric workflow

## Core Screens and Views
- **WhatsApp Conversation Interface** - Customer-facing chat with restaurant personality, menu browsing, order placement
- **Owner Dashboard Home** - Real-time metrics, satisfaction scores, branch performance comparison
- **Feedback Analytics View** - Sentiment trends, common complaints, positive highlights with Arabic/English toggle
- **Conversation Monitor** - Live conversation feed with escalation alerts and intervention capabilities
- **Personality Configuration** - Select and preview AI personality templates with sample conversations
- **Branch Management** - Multi-location routing rules, performance comparison, staff assignments
- **Reports & Insights** - Downloadable analytics, customer cohort analysis, revenue attribution

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG AA compliance for dashboard with RTL Arabic support, high contrast modes for outdoor mobile use, and voice navigation capabilities for hands-free restaurant management.

## Branding
Clean, professional design that adapts to each restaurant's brand colors and logo. WhatsApp conversations maintain platform-native feel while subtly incorporating restaurant identity through welcome messages and signature closings. No heavy branding that might feel inauthentic in messaging context.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Customer Interface:** Native WhatsApp (iOS/Android) with no additional app required
- **Owner Dashboard:** Progressive Web App optimized for mobile-first (70% usage on phones) with desktop support for detailed analytics
- **Staff Interface:** Tablet-optimized escalation handling for kitchen/counter staff
