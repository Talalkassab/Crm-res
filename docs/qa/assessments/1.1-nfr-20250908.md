# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-08
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - CORS configured for development, no rate limiting, missing auth implementation
- Performance: CONCERNS - No performance requirements defined, basic health endpoints only
- Reliability: PASS - Health checks implemented, proper error handling structure in place
- Maintainability: PASS - Test infrastructure configured, CI pipeline with matrix builds, proper structure

## Critical Issues

1. **CORS Allow All Origins** (Security)
   - Risk: Cross-origin attacks in production
   - Fix: Configure CORS for specific origins in production environment
   - Location: services/core-api/src/main.py:27

2. **No Authentication/Authorization** (Security)
   - Risk: Unprotected API endpoints
   - Fix: Implement JWT-based authentication system
   - Note: Foundation story - auth implementation planned for future stories

3. **No Rate Limiting** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential DoS attacks
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to all API endpoints
   - Effort: ~2 hours

## Quick Wins

- Configure CORS origins properly: ~30 minutes
- Add rate limiting middleware: ~2 hours  
- Add performance monitoring endpoints: ~1 hour
- Document NFR targets in architecture docs: ~30 minutes

## Assessment Details

### Security: CONCERNS
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (properly uses environment variables)
- ✅ Proper secret management with .env.example template
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled in database schema
- ❌ CORS configured with wildcard origins for development
- ❌ No rate limiting on API endpoints
- ❌ No authentication implementation (planned for future stories)
- ❌ No input validation on endpoints yet

### Performance: CONCERNS
- ✅ Basic health check endpoints implemented
- ✅ Async/await pattern used in FastAPI services
- ❌ No performance requirements specified
- ❌ No caching strategy defined
- ❌ No database query optimization yet
- ❌ No performance monitoring configured

### Reliability: PASS
- ✅ Health check endpoints implemented across services
- ✅ Proper error handling structure with FastAPI
- ✅ Docker containers with proper lifecycle management
- ✅ CI pipeline with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds for production optimization
- ✅ Database constraints and proper schema design

### Maintainability: PASS
- ✅ Test infrastructure configured (pytest, React Testing Library)
- ✅ CI pipeline with matrix builds for Node.js/Python
- ✅ Proper project structure with monorepo organization
- ✅ TypeScript configuration for type safety
- ✅ Linting and type checking in CI
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in README
- ✅ Docker containerization for consistent environments

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Pre-Production)
1. Configure CORS for specific origins
2. Implement rate limiting middleware
3. Add input validation schemas
4. Define performance SLA targets

### Future Stories
1. Implement JWT authentication system
2. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
3. Implement caching strategy (Redis)
4. Add performance testing in CI

## Quality Score: 70/100
- Security: CONCERNS (-10 points)
- Performance: CONCERNS (-10 points)  
- Reliability: PASS (0 points)
- Maintainability: PASS (0 points)

Foundation story shows solid architectural choices with proper testing and CI infrastructure. Security and performance concerns are expected at this stage and should be addressed in subsequent stories.
