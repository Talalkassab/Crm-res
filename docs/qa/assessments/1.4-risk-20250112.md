## Medium Priority Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Missing Rate Limiting on API Endpoints

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - API endpoints are exposed and could be targeted
**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to resource exhaustion and service degradation
**Affected Components**: 
- `/api/feedback-campaigns/upload`
- `/api/feedback-campaigns/{id}/schedule`
- All campaign management endpoints

**Mitigation**:
- Implement rate limiting middleware (express-rate-limit or similar)
- Set reasonable limits: 10 uploads/hour, 100 API calls/minute per user
- Add monitoring for rate limit violations
- Configure different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users

**Testing Focus**: 
- Load testing with rate limiting enabled
- Abuse scenario testing (rapid successive uploads)
- Monitoring alert validation

### 2. PERF-001: CSV Processing Not Optimized for Large Files

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Users likely to upload large customer lists
**Impact**: Medium - Memory issues and slow processing for large files
**Affected Components**:
- `CSVProcessor.validate_csv()`
- `CSVProcessor.process_recipients()`

**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming CSV processing for files >1MB
- Add progress indicators for large file processing
- Set reasonable memory limits and timeout handling
- Consider background job processing for very large files

**Testing Focus**:
- Memory usage testing with large CSV files (1GB+)
- Timeout handling tests
- Progress reporting accuracy

### 3. DATA-001: Phone Number Validation Edge Cases

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - International customers or data entry errors likely
**Impact**: Medium - Invalid messages sent, delivery failures
**Affected Components**:
- `CSVProcessor.validate_phone_number()`

**Mitigation**:
- Strengthen validation to explicitly reject non-Saudi numbers
- Add comprehensive test cases for international numbers
- Improve error messaging for validation failures
- Consider adding phone number format normalization

**Testing Focus**:
- Comprehensive phone number validation test suite
- Edge case testing with malformed numbers
- International number rejection testing

### 4. OPS-001: A/B Testing Assignments Not Properly Logged

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium - A/B tests will be run regularly
**Impact**: Low - Difficult to audit test assignments and results
**Affected Components**:
- A/B testing service
- Variant assignment tracking

**Mitigation**:
- Add comprehensive logging for all A/B test assignments
- Implement audit trail for experiment configuration changes
- Create dashboards for A/B test monitoring
- Add automated alerts for assignment imbalances

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

**Security Testing**:
- Rate limiting effectiveness tests
- API abuse scenario testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Input validation boundary tests

**Performance Testing**:
- Large CSV file processing (1MB, 10MB, 100MB)
- Memory usage monitoring during CSV processing
- Concurrent campaign creation testing
- Prayer time API timeout scenarios

**Data Integrity Testing**:
- Phone number validation edge cases
- International number rejection
- Malformed CSV handling
- Data corruption recovery

### Priority 2: Standard Functional Tests

**Campaign Workflow Tests**:
- End-to-end campaign creation and execution
- Message scheduling and delivery
- Real-time feedback processing
- Alert generation and acknowledgment

**A/B Testing Tests**:
- Variant assignment logic
- Statistical significance calculations
- Experiment configuration validation
- Results reporting accuracy

### Priority 3: Integration Tests

**External Service Integration**:
- WhatsApp API integration
- AI processor communication
- Prayer time service integration
- Supabase realtime functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Rate limiting implementation (blocks production deployment)
- PERF-001: Large CSV optimization (impacts user experience)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- DATA-001: Phone validation strengthening (with enhanced monitoring)
- All low-risk items (with appropriate logging and monitoring)

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- API rate limit violations and patterns
- CSV processing performance metrics
- Phone number validation failure rates
- A/B test assignment distributions
- Memory usage during file processing
- Prayer time API response times

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New external integrations added
- File size limits changed
- New countries or regions supported
- Performance requirements change
- Security incidents reported
- A/B testing logic modified

## Risk Score Calculation

Base Score: 100
- Medium risks (4): -5 points each = -20
- Low risks (3): -2 points each = -6
**Final Score: 74/100** (Good - manageable risks)

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Immediate Actions** (before production):
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Optimize CSV processing for large files
   - Strengthen phone number validation

2. **Short-term Improvements** (next sprint):
   - Add circuit breaker for external APIs
   - Enhance A/B testing logging
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring

3. **Long-term Enhancements**:
   - Consider distributed processing for very large campaigns
   - Add predictive analytics for campaign optimization
   - Implement advanced security monitoring
