- Large files (10,000 records)
- Edge case files (malformed data, mixed formats)

**Feedback Test Data:**
- Various sentiment ranges (-1.0 to 1.0)
- Different rating distributions (1-5 stars)
- Multiple conversation lengths
- Different topic combinations

**A/B Testing Data:**

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Priority 1: Close Critical Gaps
1. Implement A/B testing service unit tests
2. Add comprehensive error boundary testing
3. Conduct load testing for large CSV processing

## Coverage Quality Indicators

**Strengths:**
- All acceptance criteria have test coverage
- Multiple test levels for each requirement (unit, integration, E2E)
- Clear Given-When-Then documentation for traceability
- Good separation of functional and non-functional testing

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Complete A/B testing service test coverage

- Enhance performance testing scenarios
- Include accessibility testing for frontend components

## Conclusion

The implementation demonstrates excellent requirement coverage with 87.5% of acceptance criteria fully tested across multiple test levels. The identified gap in A/B testing service coverage is manageable and should be addressed before production deployment. The comprehensive test suite provides good confidence in the system's functional correctness and reliability.
