## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend Stack:**
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe development
- Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (latest) for UI components with Arabic RTL support
- Zustand 4.5+ for state management
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- Vite 5.1+ as bundler

**Backend Stack:**
- Python 3.12+ with FastAPI 0.110+
- REST + WebSockets (OpenAPI 3.0)
- asyncio + httpx for async operations
- Pytest 8.0+ for testing
- LangChain + Transformers for future AI implementation

**Infrastructure:**
- Turborepo 1.13+ for monorepo orchestration
- Docker 24+ for containerization
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database with realtime capabilities
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Pulumi (Python) for future IaC

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The monorepo must follow this exact structure:
```
crm-res/
├── apps/
│   └── dashboard/           # Next.js frontend
├── services/
│   ├── whatsapp-gateway/   # Future implementation
│   ├── ai-processor/        # Python FastAPI
│   └── core-api/           # Python FastAPI
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-types/       # TypeScript/Python types
│   └── ui-components/      # Shared React components
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── docker/
│   └── pulumi/            # Future IaC
└── scripts/               # Build/deploy scripts
```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

Initial tables to create:
- **restaurants**: Multi-tenant root with subscription_tier, personality_type, whatsapp_number
- **customers**: whatsapp_number (unique), language_preference, conversation_context JSONB
- **conversations**: Links customers to restaurants, tracks status and type
- **feedback**: Stores ratings, sentiment analysis results

Required PostgreSQL extensions:
- uuid-ossp: For UUID generation
- postgis: For future location features  
- pg_trgm: For Arabic text search

### Coding Standards to Enforce
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Type definitions must be in packages/shared-types
- API routes use kebab-case naming
- Database tables use snake_case
- React components use PascalCase
- Never access process.env directly - use config objects
- All API routes must use standard error handler

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Frontend Tests Location:**
- apps/dashboard/tests/components/ for unit tests
- apps/dashboard/tests/e2e/ for Playwright tests

**Backend Tests Location:**
- services/*/tests/unit/ for unit tests
- services/*/tests/integration/ for API tests
- Use conftest.py for pytest configuration

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Frontend unit tests with Vitest in apps/dashboard/tests/
- Backend unit tests with pytest in services/*/tests/
- Test files must follow naming: test_*.py or *.test.ts
- Maintain testing pyramid: 35% frontend unit, 35% backend unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E
- All new code requires corresponding tests
- Use fixtures for test data management
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
