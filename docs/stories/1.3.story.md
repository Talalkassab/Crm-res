### Data Models and Database Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Relevant Database Tables and Updates:**
- **conversations table:** Update ai_confidence decimal field for response quality tracking
- **customers table:** Use language_preference enum ('ar-SA', 'ar-EG', 'ar-LV', 'en') for dialect handling
- **restaurants table:** Reference personality_type enum ('formal', 'casual', 'traditional', 'modern')

**Conversation Context Storage Pattern:**
```python
# Update conversations.conversation_context JSONB field
context_entry = {
    "personality": restaurant.personality_type,
    "dialect": customer.language_preference,
    "sentiment_history": ["positive", "neutral"],
    "topics_discussed": ["food_quality", "service"],
    "escalation_triggers": [],
    "cultural_context": {
        "prayer_awareness": True,
        "greeting_style": "formal"
    }
}
```

### Authentication and Configuration
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Environment Variable Management:**
- OpenRouter API key configuration through secure config objects
- Model selection and fallback configuration
- Prayer times API caching configuration
- Restaurant personality mapping configuration

**Service Integration Patterns:**
- Message queue integration with existing Celery infrastructure from WhatsApp Gateway
- Database connection using established Supabase client patterns
- Async HTTP client configuration for OpenRouter API calls

### Coding Standards Compliance
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules for Implementation:**
- Define types in packages/shared-types and import from there for AI request/response models
- Never access process.env directly - use config objects for OpenRouter API keys
- API routes use kebab-case naming (/process-message, /health)
- Database operations use snake_case (ai_confidence, conversation_context)
- All API routes must use standard error handler
- Implement proper async/await patterns for OpenRouter API calls

### Arabic Language Processing Requirements

**Dialect Awareness Implementation:**
- Saudi dialect: Formal tone, religious sensitivity, traditional greetings
- Egyptian dialect: More casual expressions, different pronunciation patterns  
- Levantine dialect: Syrian/Lebanese/Palestinian variations in vocabulary
- Cultural phrase handling: "السلام عليكم", "بارك الله فيك", "إن شاء الله"

**Prayer Time Intelligence:**
- Cache daily prayer times per city (Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, etc.)
- 10-minute buffer before Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha prayers
- Ramadan schedule adjustments with Iftar/Suhoor awareness
- Weekend vs weekday prayer time considerations for different cities

**Sentiment Analysis Specifications:**
- Negative indicators: "سيء" (bad), "لا يعجبني" (don't like), "مشكلة" (problem)
- Positive indicators: "ممتاز" (excellent), "رائع" (wonderful), "أحب" (love)
- Escalation triggers: Repeated complaints, religious sensitivity violations, complex requests
- Confidence thresholds: <0.7 confidence requires human review
